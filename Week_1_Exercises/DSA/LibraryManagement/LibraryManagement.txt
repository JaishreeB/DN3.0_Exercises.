Understanding
Linear Search:

Suitable for small datasets where the overhead of sorting the list is not justified.
Useful when the list is unsorted or frequently modified (insertions/deletions).
Binary Search:

Preferred for large datasets due to its logarithmic time complexity.
Requires the list to be sorted, so it's beneficial when the list remains relatively static with infrequent modifications.

Analysis
Time Complexity
Linear Search:

Best-case: O(1) (element is the first in the list)
Average-case: O(n/2) â‰ˆ O(n)
Worst-case: O(n) (element is the last or not present)
Binary Search:

Best-case: O(1) (element is the middle of the list)
Average-case: O(log n)
Worst-case: O(log n)
