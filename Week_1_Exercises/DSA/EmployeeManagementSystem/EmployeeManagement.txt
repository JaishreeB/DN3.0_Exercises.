Array Representation
Arrays are a data structure that stores elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. This allows 
efficient access to elements using an index, providing constant time complexity (O(1)) for accessing any element.
Analysis
Time Complexity
Add Operation:

Time Complexity: O(1) (Average-case and Best-case, when there is space in the array)
Worst-case: O(n) (When resizing the array, which is not considered in this implementation)
Search Operation:

Time Complexity: O(n) (Average-case and Worst-case)
Traverse Operation:

Time Complexity: O(n)
Delete Operation:

Time Complexity: O(n) (Average-case and Worst-case, due to the need to shift elements)
