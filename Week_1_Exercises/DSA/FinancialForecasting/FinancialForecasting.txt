Understanding Recursive Algorithms
Recursion:

Recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself in order to solve smaller instances of the same problem.
It simplifies problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.
A recursive function typically has two parts:
Base case: The condition under which the recursion stops.
Recursive case: The part of the function where it calls itself with a smaller or simpler argument.
